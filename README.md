  Problem Statement
Procoder Bharath needs to count the number of registrations for his college fest. He's too busy for something so trivial and so he asks his juniors for help. Help him determine the fastest candidate for the job. Build a website similar to <a href=https://delta.nitt.edu/~shake/mentorship20/webdev_task_0_0.mp4>this</a> which would test a user's counting speed. Be creative!

Normal Mode

           Arrange layers of numbers randomly in a square grid and allow a user to count by tapping on the numbers in ascending order
           Time the user and display their score in seconds
           Store the 5 best times using LocalStorage and display them.
